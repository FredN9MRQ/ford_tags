description: Quick commit and push with auto-generated message
---

Please perform a quick commit and push:

1. Check git status
2. If there are changes:
   - Run: git add .
   - Create a commit message based on the changed files (be descriptive)
   - Run: git commit -m "[auto-generated message]"
   - Run: git push
   - Show me what was committed
3. If no changes, let me know

Keep it fast - don't ask me for confirmation, just do it.
